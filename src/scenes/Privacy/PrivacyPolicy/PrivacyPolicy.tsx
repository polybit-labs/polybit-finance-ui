                <h3>A. Roles.</h3>
                <br />
                <p>The General Data Protection Regulations in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (“GDPR”) distinguish between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). We act as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with the Services.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>B. Lawful Basis for Processing.</h3>
                <br />
                <p>The GDPR requires a “lawful basis” for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (i) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers or partners; (ii) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (iv) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. Where applicable, we will transfer your personal data to third parties subject to appropriate or suitable safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>C. Your Data Subject Rights</h3>
                <br />
                <p>If you are a user in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, you maintain certain rights under the GDPR. These rights include the right to (i) request access and obtain a copy of your personal data; (ii) request rectification or erasure of your personal data; (iii) object to or restrict the processing of your personal data; and (iv) request portability of your personal data. Additionally, if we have collected and processed your personal data with your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we cannot edit or delete information that is stored on a particular blockchain. This information may include transaction data (i.e., purchases, sales, and transfers) related to your blockchain wallet address and any NFTs held by your wallet address.</p>
                <br />
                <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us via our email or postal address listed in the “Contact Us” section above and specify which right you are seeking to exercise. We will respond to your request within thirty (30) days. We may require specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Please note that we retain information as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and may continue to retain and use information even after a data subject request in accordance with our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.</p>
                <br />
                <p>If you have any issues with our compliance, please contact us as set out in the “Contact Us” section above. You also reserve the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction.</p>
