    "overview": "Alpaca Finance is a decentralised finance platform that enables leveraged yield farming on the Binance Smart Chain. This lending protocol helps lenders earn safe and stable yields while borrowers can take under-collateralised loans for leveraged yield farming positions, multiplying their farming principals and resulting profits. The platform is an enabler for the entire DeFi ecosystem by amplifying the liquidity layer of integrated exchanges, improving their capital efficiency by connecting LP borrowers and lenders. Alpaca has become a fundamental building block within DeFi, providing access to finance to each and every person's fingertips and every alpaca's paw.",
    "history": "Alpaca Finance was launched in Q1 2021, offering single-asset staking, LP staking vaults, experimental synthetics, and the adoption of a deflationary buyback and burn method. Since then, the platform has grown to over $1 billion in total-value-locked and has developed partnerships with other protocols while adding staking vaults. Alpaca Finance seeks to address problems related to capital efficiency within DeFi as well as the volatile nature of the yield farming market. Lenders receive the ability to earn yield for lending their assets through continuous interest accrual of the Alpaca token itself, as well as other popular tokens such as BTC, ETH, and BNB. Undercollateralized loans are often used by borrowers on the platform to increase their farming positions, and thus, their yield. The nature of these loans also enables borrowers the ability to create synthetic shorts. Alpaca implements a deflationary token buyback and burn method for a percentage of platform fees such as lending interest and liquidations. A portion of certain platform revenues will be burned and removed from the total supply forever, and the more Alpaca is used, the more tokens are burned.",
