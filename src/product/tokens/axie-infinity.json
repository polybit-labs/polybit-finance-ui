    "overview": "Axie Infinity is a digital game that combines NFT collectibles and blockchain. Players can collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures called Axies. With over 500 different body parts available, Axies can take various forms and can have any combination of body parts, making them highly variable and often rare and unique. Each Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT) with different attributes and strengths, and can be entered into 3v3 battles, with the winning team earning more experience (exp) points that are used to level up an Axie's stats or evolve their body parts. Axies can be bred together to produce new and unique offspring, which can be used or sold on the Axie marketplace. The Axie Infinity ecosystem also has its own unique governance token, known as Axie Infinity Shards (AXS), which are used to participate in key governance votes and will give holders a say in how funds in the Axie Community Treasury are spent.",
    "history": "Axie Infinity was created in 2018 by Sky Mavis, a technology-focused game developer based in Vietnam. It was co-founded by Trung Nguyen and Aleksander Larsen. Trung Nguyen, the current CEO of the platform, graduated with a BS in computer software engineering and worked as a software engineer at Anduin Transactions prior to founding Axie Infinity. Former competitive gamer Aleksander Larsen is also credited as a co-founder and COO of the platform, and has been working in blockchain gaming since 2017.\n\nAxie Infinity is one of the pioneers of the Play-to-Earn (P2E) concept, where gamers earn crypto and NFTs through gaming activity. As part of the online game, users participate in turn-based battles, but the main difference is that gamers have control over their characters, land plots, resources, and other in-game items of the universe. Axie Infinity is an open digital universe, where the economy is controlled by its players. Ownership of in-game assets and unique digital items is verified via NFTs. The tokens act as a receipt proving the right to property. Hence, users can both sell their Axies to other players and store them securely in crypto wallets like Trust Wallet, Binance Chain Wallet, or Ronin Wallet, which was specially designed for Axie Infinity. \n\nAXS is the governance token for the Axie Infinity game. Token holders will be able to shape and vote for the direction of the game universe. AXS holders will also be able to stake their tokens to earn more AXS and even vote for governance proposals. This is unlike traditional games where all decisions are made by the game developers.",
