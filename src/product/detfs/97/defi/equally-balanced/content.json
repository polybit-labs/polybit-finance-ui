        "DeFi stands for Decentralised Finance, which refers to a system of financial applications that operate on a decentralised blockchain network, such as Ethereum, rather than traditional financial intermediaries like banks. DeFi platforms offer various financial services, including lending, borrowing, trading, and more, all without relying on central authorities to manage transactions or hold assets. ",
        "DeFi platforms are accessible to anyone with an internet connection and a digital asset wallet, allowing anyone to participate in financial services regardless of their location or socioeconomic status.",
        "It is a relatively new and rapidly evolving space, with new platforms and applications being developed all the time. This provides opportunities for innovation and growth in the financial sector for new investment opportunities, including staking, liquidity provision, and yield farming, which can provide investors with attractive returns.",
        "Polybitâ€™s DeFi Equally Balanced DETF tracks DeFi tokens on the Binance Smart Chain, equally weighted by the total number of tokens in the DETF."
